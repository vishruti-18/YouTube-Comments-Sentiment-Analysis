# YouTube Comments Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on YouTube comments to extract meaningful insights and visualize trends. Using Python, the YouTube Data API, and various data visualization libraries, this analysis provides an understanding of comment sentiment, commenter activity, and time-based patterns.

## Objectives
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of YouTube comments.
- **Time-based Patterns**: Explore how sentiment and comment activity change over time.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to illustrate findings and trends.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Comments are retrieved dynamically using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3).
- **Fields**: Comment text, timestamp, commenter name.

You provide the YouTube video ID, and the script fetches the comments in real-time for analysis.

## Installation

To run this project locally, install the required libraries by running:
pip install google-api-python-client pandas nltk wordcloud matplotlib textblob seaborn

## Usage
1. **API Key Setup**: Ensure you have a valid [YouTube Data API Key](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. **Run the Analysis**: Execute the provided Jupyter Notebook to fetch comments and perform sentiment analysis.
   - In `notebook.ipynb`, enter the video ID for which you want to analyze the comments.

## Future Work
- **Advanced Sentiment Analysis**: Explore more sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques (e.g., using deep learning models like BERT).
- **Feature Expansion**: Integrate additional features such as video view counts, like/dislike ratios, and keyword analysis.
- **Extended Dataset**: Analyze comments from a wider range of videos for more comprehensive insights.
